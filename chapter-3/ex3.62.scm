; Exercise 3.62: Use the results of Exercise 3.60 and Exer-
; cise 3.61 to deÔ¨Åne a procedure div-series that divides two
; power series. div-series should work for any two series,
; provided that the denominator series begins with a nonzero
; constant term. (If the denominator has a zero constant term,
; then div-series should signal an error.) Show how to use
; div-series together with the result of Exercise 3.59 to gen-
; erate the power series for tangent.
