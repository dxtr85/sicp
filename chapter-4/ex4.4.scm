; Exercise 4.4: Recall the definitions of the special forms and
; and or from Chapter 1:
; * and: The expressions are evaluated from left to right.
; If any expression evaluates to false, false is returned;
; any remaining expressions are not evaluated. If all the
; expressions evaluate to true values, the value of the
; last expression is returned. If there are no expressions
; then true is returned.
; * or: The expressions are evaluated from left to right.
; If any expression evaluates to a true value, that value
; is returned; any remaining expressions are not evalu-
; ated. If all expressions evaluate to false, or if there are
; no expressions, then false is returned.
; Install and and or as new special forms for the evaluator by
; deÔ¨Åning appropriate syntax procedures and evaluation pro-
; cedures eval-and and eval-or. Alternatively, show how to
; implement and and or as derived expressions.
